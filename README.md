# iFogSim2
A Toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and Fog Computing Environments withe the following new features:
 * Mobility-support and Migration Management
 * Microservice Orchestration
 * Dynamic Distributed Clustering

## How to run iFogSim2 ?
* Create a Java project. 
* Inside the project directory, initialize an empty Git repository with the following command
```
git init
```
* Add the Git repository of iFogSim2 as the `origin` remote.
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim2
```
* Pull the contents of the repository to your machine.
```
git pull origin master
```
* Include the JARs to your project.  
* Run the example files (e.g. TranslationServiceFog_Clustering.java, CrowdSensing_Microservices_RandomMobility_Clustering.java) to get started.
